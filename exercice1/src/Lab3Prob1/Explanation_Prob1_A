p1.equals(p2) scenario : The execution of the instruction p1.equals(p2) return false because when it is executed 
                     the "equals" method in the class "PersonWithJob" is invoked and as p2 is not an 
                     instance of PersonWithJob then the method return false.


p2.equals(p1) scenario :  The execution of p2.equals(p1) return true because when it is executed, 
                     the method "equals" in the class Person is invoked. In Person.equals, this line 
                    "if(!(aPerson instanceof Person)) return false;" compares p1 with p2 and 
                      since p1 is also a Person by virtue of inheritance, that line is not triggered and 
                      also p1.name is equal to p2.name here.
