Answer : The first problem with inheritance here is the fact that it violates the "IS-A" and "LSP" principals
         because a circle is not a cylinder; they are two different objects and you cannot use one where the other one 
         is expected in reality. Besides, it is a waste of inheritance opportunity as circle don't need to use the 
         method "computeVolume" and it does not need the instance height.
